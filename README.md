## "Movie App" Movie Trending and Seachering App Using ReactJS 
***
### Overview

This is my first React App. The main function of it is to show the most popular movies in the past week, and provide the searching function in order to search a certain movie that the user want. The detail information, such as release date, rating score, overview and stage photo are also able to be seen by just clicking the movie poster.

### Details

This React App is powered by The Movie DB api, which provide free api key to developers. It has a lot of api for us to use:

* Get the trending movies in the past week.
* Get the searched movies using key works.
* Get a certain movie's poster, backdrop, date of release, rating score and its genre.

 This App uses Axios library, which is used to make HTTP requests from Node.js. It allows me to query data from the The Movie DB to gether tons of information.
